## Tutorial Philosophy

Our tutorials follow these principles:

- **Learning-oriented**: Focus on building your understanding, not just completing tasks
- **Rewarding**: Each tutorial produces something tangible you can be proud of
- **Safe**: All tutorials use isolated test environments—you can't break anything
- **Progressive**: Start simple, build complexity gradually

## Before You Begin

Most tutorials assume you have:

- Access to a Nexus CMDB instance (or can install one)
- Basic familiarity with REST APIs or command-line tools
- A text editor for configuration files

Don't worry if you're missing something—we'll guide you through setup steps in each tutorial.
