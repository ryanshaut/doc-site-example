# How to Use This Documentation

This documentation is organized using the **[Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/)**, a systematic approach to technical documentation that ensures you can find what you need, when you need it.

## What is Diátaxis?

Diátaxis (Greek for "arrangement" or "organization") divides documentation into four distinct categories, each serving a different purpose and answering different user needs. Understanding these categories will help you navigate this site more effectively and find information faster.

## The Four Documentation Pillars

### :material-school: Tutorials – Learning by Doing

**Purpose**: Help you learn through hands-on practice

**Best for**:

- You're new to Nexus CMDB
- You want to learn the basics through guided exercises
- You prefer step-by-step instructions with concrete outcomes
- You're building foundational knowledge

**What you'll find**: Complete, structured lessons that take you from start to finish. Each tutorial is designed to be safe, repeatable, and rewarding—you'll build something tangible while learning core concepts.

**Example**: "Creating Your First CI" walks you through installation and creating your first configuration item.

### :material-wrench: How-To Guides – Solving Problems

**Purpose**: Help you accomplish specific tasks

**Best for**:

- You have a specific problem to solve
- You already know the basics and need practical solutions
- You want direct, actionable steps
- You're working on a real project right now

**What you'll find**: Task-oriented recipes that assume you understand the basics. These guides get straight to the point and show you how to solve common problems you'll encounter in production.

**Example**: "Fixing Duplicate CIs" provides practical steps to identify and resolve duplicate configuration items.

### :material-lightbulb: Discussions – Understanding Concepts

**Purpose**: Help you understand the "why" behind design decisions

**Best for**:

- You want to understand why something works the way it does
- You're making architectural decisions
- You need to evaluate if Nexus CMDB fits your use case
- You want to deepen your conceptual knowledge

**What you'll find**: Explanatory content about concepts, philosophy, and design trade-offs. These aren't step-by-step guides—they're deep dives into the thinking behind features and approaches.

**Example**: "Why Relationship Modeling Matters" explains the importance of explicit relationships in CMDBs.

### :material-book-open: Reference – Looking Up Details

**Purpose**: Provide technical specifications and detailed information

**Best for**:

- You need to look up syntax, parameters, or API details
- You're already familiar with the system
- You want comprehensive technical specifications
- You're debugging or implementing specific features

**What you'll find**: Dry but thorough technical documentation. API specifications, data models, configuration options, and complete parameter lists. This is your go-to resource when you know what you're looking for.

**Example**: "API Conventions" documents all REST API endpoints with parameters and response formats.

## Which Section Should I Use?

Use this quick reference to find the right section:

| I want to... | Go to... |
| ------------ | -------- |
| Learn Nexus CMDB from scratch | [Tutorials](tutorials/) |
| Solve a specific problem I'm facing | [How-To Guides](how-to/) |
| Understand why something works this way | [Discussions](discussions/) |
| Look up API syntax or technical details | [Reference](reference/) |
| Get started quickly | [Tutorials → Creating Your First CI](tutorials/first-ci.md) |
| Evaluate if Nexus fits my needs | [Discussions → Design Philosophy](discussions/design-philosophy.md) |

## Following a Learning Path

If you're new to Nexus CMDB, we recommend this progression:

1. **Start with Tutorials** – Build hands-on experience with the basics
2. **Reference How-To Guides** – Apply your knowledge to real problems
3. **Read Discussions** – Deepen your understanding of concepts and design
4. **Use Reference** – Look up details as you work on advanced implementations

## Why This Matters

Traditional documentation often mixes all these types together, making it hard to find what you need. By separating them:

- **You save time** – No more digging through tutorials when you just need an API reference
- **You learn better** – Learning content stays focused on learning, not buried in technical specs
- **You get context** – Explanations are separate from instructions, so both can be more effective

## Still Lost?

If you're not sure where to start:

- **Complete beginner?** → [Creating Your First CI](tutorials/first-ci.md)
- **Need to solve something now?** → [How-To Guides](how-to/)
- **Want the big picture?** → [Design Philosophy](discussions/design-philosophy.md)
- **Looking for specific information?** → Use the search box at the top of the page
